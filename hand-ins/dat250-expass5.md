I decided to try using mongoDB's GUI instead of the shell as we are only just getting to know it, 
and are not really doing any difficult operations

### Experiment 1

### Experiment 2
I recreated the map-reduce function using the Aggregation $group

### Thoughts

The map-reduce operation groups students by course and counts them, 
providing a quick overview of enrollment numbers per course. 
This is useful for analyzing student distribution and aiding in decisions like resource allocation or scheduling.

I didn't really have any issues with the assignment.
