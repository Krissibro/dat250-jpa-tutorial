# Expass 6

I decided once again to do it in kotlin instead of java because kotlin is cool and epic.
I didn't really have any problems this assignment, the only issue I had was deciding where to upload the code, 
as I didn't want to create so many single use git repos. 
I decided to put the code in the jpa tutorial repo.

I got everything to work without many issues.
The only thing I was unsure about was where to add my arguments to further send as I didn't have kotlin setup
in the terminal.
I fixed this using the run configurations in Intellij, where I just added whatever arguments I needed.
