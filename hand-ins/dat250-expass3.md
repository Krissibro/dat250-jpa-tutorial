## Expass 3

I implemented a very simple frontend with some basic styling and UI.
I did make some changes to the frontend shown in task to better fit the design of my backend.
Both the frontend and the backend are set up together in this git repo.

I spent a bunch of time getting the frontend and backend folders to work properly, when running the respective technologies.
For gradle I had to reconfigure many parts of the project for it to work properly
It was mainly getting all the different parts to be in the correct positions in the file structure.
After fiddling for a while I got it working.

And for svelte I had some issues getting specifically vite to work.
The problem was that I used the wrong command to generate the svelte project and some configurations we're wrong.
When I decided to just remake the entire project with SvelteKit instead of just Vite everything worked just fine.
Even setting up the proxy for the backend was easy.

Another issue I had was that I was not very familiar with tailwind.
I wanted to try it and since this project is quite simple I decided to go for it.
It was a bit tricky to get into, nut with some help from chatGPT and som trial and error, I got the hang of it after a while.
I also think I spent way too much time on the styling and should have cleaned up the features instead.

I have used svelte before, so the coding process other than the styling for the frontend was pretty straight forward.
I do regret using TypeScript though as this project is quite simple and I think just normal Javascript would have worked just fine.
